# ReactCardFlip

React Card Flip is allows you to use the card flipping animation. Credit for the
CSS goes to [David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip).


## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [Demo](http://www.aaronccwong.com/react-card-flip/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) should open in a browser. If not
you can go to that directly.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-card-flip is to install it from NPM with the
command:

```
yarn add react-card-flip
```

You can also use the standalone build by including `lib/react-card-flip.js` in
your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is
available as a global variable.


## Usage

To use this component, first import ReactCardFlip:

```javascript
import ReactCardFlip from 'react-card-flip';
```

and then provide it with two child components with keys marked `front` and `back`
so that the component can tell which component should be in the front and which
component should be in the back.

This component only allows for manual card flip so make sure to include a tag
that has an onClick handler for each side of the card.

The animation itself will be controlled by the prop `isFlipped`. Use this to
control whether to show the front or the back of the card.

```javascript
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      isFlipped: false
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.setState({ isFlipped: !this.state.isFlipped });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ReactCardFlip isFlipped={this.state.isFlipped}>
        <YOUR_FRONT_CCOMPONENT key="front">
          This is the front of the card.
          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click to flip</button>
        </FrontComponent>

        <YOUR_BACK_COMPONENT key="back">
          This is the back of the card.
          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click to flip</button>
        </BackComponent>
      </ReactCardFlip>
    )
  }
}
```

`YOUR_FRONT_CCOMPONENT` and `YOUR_BACK_COMPONENT` here are meant to be the two
components that you plan to use for the card, one for the front of the card
and one for the back of the card.

The most important part is providing the key props with the values `front` and
`back` to your two components so that `ReactCardFlip` can differentiate between
the two components. `key="front"` tells `ReactCardFlip` to use that component as
the front of the card. Similarly, `key="back"` tells `ReactCardFlip` to use that
component as the back of the card.

### Properties

| Props                | Type    | Description                                                                                                                 | Default   |
|----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| isFlipped            | bool    | False to show the front of the card, true to show the back                                                                  | undefined |
| flipSpeedBackToFront | number  | The speed of the flip animation when the card flips from back to front, the higher the number the slower the flip animation | 0.6       |
| flipSpeedFrontToBack | number  | The speed of the flip animation when the card flips from front to back, the higher the number the slower the flip animation | 0.6       |
| infinite             | bool    | False to rotate in opposite directions on both sides of the card, true to rotate in the same direction                      | false     |

## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).

## Testing

To run tests for this project run one of the following commands:

* `npm test` - Runs tests then exits
* `npm test:watch` - Runs tests in watch mode
* `npm test:coverage` - Runs tests and creates a coverage report
